# Dependencies

Internally, EZUI is using a couple of dependencies. These dependencies are either core or adjunct dependencies. Adjunct dependencies are easily changable whereas core dependencies are chosen and used long-term.

## Core

### React

EZUI is built for [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. EZUI embaces React >16.8 (the one with hooks), and uses [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

### GreenSock Animation Library (GSAP)

The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, SVG, React, canvas, generic objects, whatever) and solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery). See why GSAP is used by roughly 10,000,000 sites and many major brands.

## Adjunct

To be updated.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand beyond React in the future. Stay tuned.
